# Chinese-term-webscraper
Takes a list of chinese terms in a .docx file and outputs the definition in another word doc. This is a simple project and does not work very well.
Terms are only taken from Baidu baike.
# How to use:
1. Make sure "file.docx" is in the same directory as the script.
2. In the word document, each chinese term should be on a different line.
3. Run the script
4. "output.docx" will be created and will include the chinese definitions.

Note that the definitions are shortened because no one wants to read an entire paragraph just for a definition.
Definitions may be incorrect.
